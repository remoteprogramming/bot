Title: Refactor Bot

Context:

* Many of the desicions of the previous sessions like, registering a command, we just need to have its implementation
and the bot takes care of registering it and others, are covered by the Sapphire framework. So In this session
we are refactoring the bot to use it.


Status:
Caique - agreed

Marcelo - agreed

William - agreed

Consequences:
The upside of this is that errors can be caught upfront and developer tools can better support us with writing valid code
