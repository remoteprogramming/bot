Title: Initial bot code

Context:
* Create the main file and connected bot to Discord. Team defined to use dotenv to keep all configuration as environment variables following [12 factor](https://12factor.net/pt_br/config)

* We defined that bot code will be organized as components, so all functionality will be self-contained.

* Initialy this will be used directly, but we will create a config component
* We defined commands will handle by a CommandRegister component which will ready from a yaml.
Using this yaml, commandRegister will load dinamically commands implementation from commands folder. Implementation file will follow the **command-name**-*cmd*.js convention.
```yaml
commands:
  - name: <command name>
    description: <command description>
```

* Unit tests are written with [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) as assertion library

Consequences:
The upside of this is that errors can be caught upfront and developer tools can better support us with writing valid code
